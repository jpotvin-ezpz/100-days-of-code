### Day 03: January 20th, 2021
 
**Today's Progress**: Building a discord bot! 

**Thoughts**: Projects definitely are the best way to test my understanding and see what I'm strugglign with when 'thrown into the deep' as it were.

**Links(s) to work**: Can't link the bot to github because of a token that would compromise my discord server's security
