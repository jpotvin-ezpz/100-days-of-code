### Day 03: January 20th, 2021
 
**Today's Progress**: Building a discord bot! 

**Thoughts**: Projects definitely are the best way to test my understanding and see what I'm strugglign with when 'thrown into the deep' as it were.

**Links(s) to work**: Can't link the bot to github because of a token that would compromise my discord server's security 

### Day 04: January 21st, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Spent 4 hours building a discord bot with a friend. 

**Thoughts**: Projects are fun, actually brings a lot of joy to the coding experience.

**Links(s) to work**: Github Private Repo, will make public when bot is finished and I can remove the token from the project

### Day 04: January 21st, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Codewars 7kyu problem that's normally pretty easy but decided to restrict myself from using a for loop

**Thoughts**: yes thats right, i'm back again on the same day after a ton of coding already. I went back to codewars and did a problem that is easily solved with an iterative function and I struggled trying to make it recursive showing how poor my skills with recursive problem solving are so I decided after an hour to leave it for tomorrow.
