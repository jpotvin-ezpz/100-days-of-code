**Today's Progress**: Learned about Regular Expressions

**Thoughts**: When I initially worked through the Regular Expressions section in the FCC curriculum I found the last few problems to be really difficult and after I solved them I didn't really have a better understanding of how things worked. So I'm glad I revisited it and went through a more **visual** guide.

### Day 01: November 03, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Finished Regular Expressions, Worked *almost* all the way through the 4th Beginner JS module (DOM)

**Thoughts**: When it comes to learning JS, it seems more complicated than it actually ends up being. It seems to be a language that grew organically. There was some pre-thought paths but it seems like new problems came up, they make a solution, and so and so fother.
