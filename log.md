**Today's Progress**: Learned About Regular Expressions

**Thoughts**: When I initially worked through the Regular Expressions section in the FCC curriculum I found the last few problems to be really difficult and after I solved them I didn't really have a better understanding of how things worked. So I'm glad I revisited it and went through a more **visual** guide.
