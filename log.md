# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: November 02, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Created a New Front-End Syllabus using FreeCodeCamp's Curriculum, Nikita Rudenko's Advice, and Roadmap.sh 

**Thoughts:** I'm excited to commit to 100daysofcode and hopefully start making exponentially more progress on learning Front-End Web Development

### Day 0: November 02, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Learned about Regular Expressions

**Thoughts**: When I initially worked through the Regular Expressions section in the FCC curriculum I found the last few problems to be really difficult and after I solved them I didn't really have a better understanding of how things worked. So I'm glad I revisited it and went through a more **visual** guide.

### Day 01: November 03, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Finished Regular Expressions, Worked *almost* all the way through the 4th Beginner JS module (DOM)

**Thoughts**: When it comes to learning JS, it seems more complicated than it actually ends up being. It seems to be a language that grew organically. There was some pre-thought paths but it seems like new problems came up, they make a solution, and so and so fother.

### Day 02: November 04, 2020

**Today's Progress**: In the AM, solved JS Algorithm Problem

**Thoughts**: I have to remember to continually apply the principles from *A Mind For Numbers* so I can practice the meta-skill of problem solving.

### Day 02: November 04, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Finished Module 4 of Beginner JS, Watched all of Brad Traversy' Roadmap video

**Thoughts**: Cardio took about 2 hours, it was fun, I got to see my weaknesses, but I was also very happy to be able to test myself. Will definitely use WesBos' courses in the future as his teaching style works super well with me.

### Day 17: November 28th,2020

**Today's Progress**: Started Module 9 and solved 20+ problems on FCC, finishing the Functional Programming module

**Thoughts**: Really applied myself and coded for a long time, used the RSA method and wrote notes, didn't give up to early when things got difficult, but If I couldn't figure it out I humbled myself, asked the question, found the answer, and applied it, then checked for actual understanding and not the illusion of competancy.
